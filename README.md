# HeadCount 2.0

HeadCount 2.0 is a project designed to challenge my skills at manipulating data and creating small, reusable React components, as well as obtaining complete testing coverage through unit and assurance tests.  

## Goals for this project

* Separate application logic into small, testable functions.
* Create modular, reusable React components.
* Use propTypes to validate props passed to each component.
* Write meaningful, comprehensive unit and integration tests.
